# CodeBreaker

An open source browser extension for modifying Season 2 of BreakTheCode. This includes raw access to the vuex store, as well as a lot of convenience helper functions. It also includes type definitions.

It fixes a few bugs/oversights, enables unused/hidden content, and will probably even add some new codes in the future.
